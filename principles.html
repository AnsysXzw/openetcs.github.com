		opportunity to all. Everyone can participate under the same rules; there
		are no rules to exclude any potential contributors which include, of
		course, direct competitors in the marketplace.</li>
	<li><b>Transparency</b> - Project discussions, minutes, deliberations,
		project plans, plans for new features, and other artifacts are open,
		public, and easily accessible.</li>
	<li><b>Meritocracy</b> - openETCS is a meritocracy. The more you
		contribute the more responsibility you will earn. Leadership roles
		in openETCS are also merit-based and earned by peer acclaim.</li>
