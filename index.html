    European Train Control System (ETCS)<br />
    Open Proof. Open Source.
  </h1>                                   

  <p>
    The purpose of the openETCS project is to develop an integrated modelling, development, validation and testing framework for leveraging the cost-efficient and reliable implementation of ETCS. The framework will provide a holistic tool chain across the whole development process of ETCS software. The tool chain will support the formal specification and verification of the ETCS system requirements, the automatic and ETCS compliant code generation and validation, and the model-based test case generation and execution.

      <h2>Specification</h2>
      <p>
        openETCS will utilize “Open Standards” on all levels, including hardware and software specifica¬tion, interface definition, design tools, verification and validation procedures and last but not least embedded control software. By applying those technologies and related business concepts a significant cost cut for the final onboard product is expected down to or even below conventional high performance cab signalling systems (e.g. LZB Linien-Zug-Beeinflussung, as used in Germany, Austria and Spain).
