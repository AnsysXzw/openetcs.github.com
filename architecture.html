   Behind the scenes<br/> 
 </h1>

 <p>
   RAP mobile has a server centric architecture which allows for high data security, fast access and 
   central deployment.

 <h3>Client-Server Communication</h3>    
 <p>
   In RAP a UI exists in two representations. The first one is on the server, where the UI exists as plain Data Objects. The 
   second one is on the client. This is the visual representation. To accommodate this separation and to 
   achieve a synchronous state RAP uses a <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a> based protocol and communicates via HTTP.  
   <br /><br /> 
   UI Events are executed on the client and will be only sent to the server when the server is interested in 
   the event. If the server reacts with a state change, it notifies the client about the change in the 
   response.
   <br /><br />
   In this way all application data is kept on the server and only the representation of the data is sent to the client using 
   secure channels such as HTTPS.  
 </p>

 <h3>Rendering the application on the client</h3> 
 <p>
   As mentioned, RAP uses JSON to synchronize the client with the server. As a result every UI Toolkit can be docked to the 
   server if it's underlying technology can process JSON. The <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Protocol">protocol</a> itself is 
   part of the RAP Open Source project and is well specified.
 </p>  

 <h3>Coding in Java</h3>
 <p>
   Because of the distributed nature of RAP you can write your app entirely in Java. The application code will be executed on the 
   server side only. This gives you the option to develop RAP mobile apps using the development environment of your choice, avoiding vendor lock-in.
